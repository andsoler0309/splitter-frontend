# Splitter Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

A modern, minimal landing page for Splitter â€” paste a YouTube URL, choose stems (Bass, Drums, Vocals), and click Split Now. No backend wired yet.

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router)
- React 18
- TailwindCSS 3

## Development

Run locally (after installing dependencies):

```
# install deps
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- The Split Now button uses a placeholder handler that shows an alert.
- Styling is fully responsive and uses Tailwind utility classes.
